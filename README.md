About
Welcome to another tutorial on Keras. This tutorial will be exploring how to build a Fully Connected Neural Network model for Object Classification on Mnist Dataset. Let's get straight into it!

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
